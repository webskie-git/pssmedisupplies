The backing is a knitted material that will absorb moisture from surrounding wet skin and provide a comfortable warm feel, unlike other products that may initially feel cold to the skin.From a safety perspective, the material backing also prevents adhesion to the skin or stoma button when bib is wet, as adhesion from unlined protectors can reduce the ability for a patient to breath properly.For added comfort and breathability the Cascade Protector can be worn over a Sofshield Protector or alternative filter, however this is not essential due to the backing material.The protector is an aesthetically pleasing white in colour and supplied in pairs to allow drying time.",
